# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project that estimates the price of a car based on various features. The project is implemented using Streamlit for the front-end and machine learning models for the price prediction.

## Features
- Predicts car prices based on input features.
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- Utilizes machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Supports exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Memo2004/Car-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Car-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run CarApp.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Streamlit application in your browser.
2. Enter the required car details such as brand, model year, mileage, etc.
3. Click on the **Predict Price** button to get the estimated car price.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features like car brand, model year, engine size, mileage, and other specifications that influence car pricing.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced machine learning techniques.
- Add more features for better predictions.
- Deploy the model using cloud services.
